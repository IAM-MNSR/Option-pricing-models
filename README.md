# Option-pricing-models
Option Pricing Models (OPM) is a project that I have created to improve my skills. I want others to share their ideas and different approaches so that we all can learn.
I have used Black Scholes ( created by Prudhvi Reddy, Muppala ) as a base or inspiration. Others include Monte Carlo simulation and my own pricing model.
